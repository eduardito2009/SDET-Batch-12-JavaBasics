inheritance in Java:
It's a mechanism in Java through which a child class gets the properties and methods from a parent class.
Benefits of inheritance:
    1)Saves time to code
    2)Code duplication is reduced
    3)Execution time is faster
Disadvantages:
    Classes are tightly coupled if we change something in parent class it is also changed in the child class.
Types of inheritance:
    there are 4 types of inheritance but Java only support 3 of them
    1)Single
    2)Hierarchical
    3)Multilevel
    4)Multiple( not supported in Java)
Single inheritance:
    In single inheritance we have only one child and one parent class. or only 2 classes participate in inheritance
    one as child one as parent.
 Class Parent{


 }
 class child extends Parent{

 }
 Hierarchical:
     In Hierarchical inheritance we have a single Parent class and multiple child classes

class Parent{

}
class child1 extends Parent{

}
class child2 extends Parent{

}
Multilevel:
    We have multiple levels of inheritance for example if we have classes A B C
    class C will be inherited from B and B will be inherited from A.
Class A{

}
Class B extends from A{

}
Class C extends from B{

}

Super keyword:
Is like "this" it refers to the parent class object for example we can access the fields method or constructor
of parent class inside the child class suing this keyword.
