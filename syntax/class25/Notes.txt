Abstract classes in Java:
Abstract classes in Java are the classes with abstract keyword.We use abstract classes to achieve abstraction.
Abstraction:
     Is the process of hiding implementation details and only showing the functionality to end user.

 Benefits:
  1) reduces the complexity.
  2) improves the maintainability of the system
  3) Can also enforce rules utp to a certain limit.
  Disadvantage:
  1) Classes get tightly coupled
class Dog{
String name;
static String int legs=4;
//concrete class
}

public abstract class Phone{
String make;
String model;
static boolean has5G=true
}
Rules:
  Abstract classes can have all the things that regular classes do, but we can't create their objects directly and
  if a class is inheriting from the abstract class it must either provide the implementation for the abstract method
  or it must be declared abstract

1) We can't have final and abstract keywords with a method at the same time.
2) We can't have static and abstract keywords with a method at the same time.
3) Abstract keywords with fields not allowed
Interface:
Interfaces are also used to achieve abstraction in Java we can create an interface with the keyword interface.

interface Human{
public static final int legs =2;

}
