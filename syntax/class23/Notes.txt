Super Keyword:
super is keyword like "this" keyword, but it refers to the parent class object we can use the super keyword on 3
different ways.
1)To access the super class variables if we have same named variables in super class and base class.
2)If we have same method names in the parent class and child class we can use the super keyword to access the parent
class method otherwise by default java refers to the child class methods.
3)As constructors don't participate in inheritance we can use super() to call the constructors from the parent class
Rules:
1)If we have a constructor in the parent class that takes two arguments we must have a constructor inside the child
class that at least takes those two arguments.
2) we can't use this() and super() inside the same constructor.
3)super can't be used in static methods

Method overloading in Java:
If we have same name methods in a class with different number of parameters or different sequence of parameters or
different data types of the parameters it is called method overloading.
class calculator{
add(int number,int number2){
}
add(int number, double number2{
}
add(double number2, int number{

}
add(double number, double number2){

}
add(int number, int number2, int number3){

}
}
