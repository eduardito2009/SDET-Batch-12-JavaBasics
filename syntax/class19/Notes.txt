Access Modifiers in Java:

Access modifiers allow us to control the visibility of class members (fields, methods,constructors etc.)
and classes itself in java.
There are 4 access levels and there are 3 keywords that we used to define these access level fourth level is
applier when we haven't used any access modifier keyword.
Levels from most restricted to less restricted are:
1)private ( keyword is also private)
2)default ( no keyword means default access level)
3)protected ( Keyword is also protected)
4)public (Keyword is also public)
Rules:
1)We should always prefer private access modifier for the fields. Because fields contain the data and the
methods of your class might use that data to perform some task if we don't perform checks before setting the
values to these fields our classes and methods might misbehave also the access of the data should be restricted
so that not every

2) We can't use access modifiers with local variables

Constructors in Java allowed us to set the values of the fields of a class

No argument constructor

write some important lines of code that you want to execute when the object of a class is created for example
you might want to fetch some info from internet or from your hard disk to give initial values to the fields
