Method overloading in Java:
when same method name exists in a class but with different number of parameters or different sequence of parameters.
Advantages of method overloading:
   Flexibility of having same name methods in a class
   End user gets the benefit that he does not need to remember different method names
Rules:
   We overload the constructors
   We can overload the static method as well.
   We can overload the main methods as well
Rules for static methods:
Static methods can't access instance fields directly
Instance methods can access instances well static fields directly
Method overriding :
1)Method overriding happens when we have same name methods in the parent class and in the child class
2)We can only override a method if we have inheritance relationship between two classes
3)We can't override the private methods because they don't participate in inheritance
4)We can't override the constructors methods because they don't participate in inheritance
