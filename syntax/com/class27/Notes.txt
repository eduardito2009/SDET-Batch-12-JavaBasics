Collections Framework in Java:
Is a collection of classes that help us manage and manipulate dat in a better way.
1) Arraylist
    *This class has many built-in methods like add(), remove(), clear() etc.
    *Dynamic and can adjust their size at run time.

 ArrayList<> arrayList=new ArrayList<>()
 ArrayList=> name of the class
 <> => diamond operator we specify the data type
 Wrapper classes
 byte => Byte
 short => Short
 int => Integer
 double => Double
 char => Character
 Why we have wrapper classes?
  1) we get built in methods
  2) a lot of frameworks don't support primitives
 When to use primitive:
  1)when we care about the memory because primitives occupy 4 times less memory as compare to wrapper
  2)Performance
 when to use Wrapper
 when we care about our ease.
